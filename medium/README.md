- Operates three unique services, in three different runtimes, each exposing a single, unary RPC (python, node, go)
- Python client calls all three RPCs
- Services and client share a network with hard-coded IPs
- Ideal file structure is suggested
- Code gen is done via distinct tools (protoc, python grpc-tools and node grpc\_tools)
- Code gen scripts are centralized into single bash file
